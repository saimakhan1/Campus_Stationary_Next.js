# Campus Stationery Store Web Application

The **Campus Stationery Store** is a web application built with **Next.js 15/16** (App Router) that allows students and staff to browse stationery products online. It includes mock authentication for staff, a public-facing landing page, product listing, product details, and a protected admin dashboard to add new products.
